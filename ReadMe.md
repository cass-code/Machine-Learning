# ReadMe

This R project contains the code and write up for my Data science 871 machine learning assignment.

The data used is the NIDS data and should be downloaded into the data folder and read in using the haven package  (the data has the extension .dta.)

All binary files can be found in the bin folder (which includes the questionnaire specific to the NIDS wave 5 data used).
The main project document is called 20346212MLProject.
"Data Work.Rmd" and "Data Manipulation 2.Rmd" can be ignored - they were used for testing and checking code in a safe environment.

All functions are stored in the folder code - the functions that are important are explained in the project document 20346212MLProject. Some of the functions are redundant and were used to test ideas.
All tex files and code used for referencing is stored in the Tex folder.

The SQL r script should be run first
