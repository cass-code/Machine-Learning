# ReadMe

This R project contains the code and write up for my Data science 871 machine learning assignment.

The data used is the NIDS data and should be downloaded into the data folder and read in using the haven package as the data has the extension .dta.

All binary files can be found in the bin folder (which includes the questionnaire specific to the NIDS data used).
The main project document is called 20346212MLProject.
"Data Work.Rmd" and "Data Manipulation 2.Rmd" can be ignored - they were used for testing and checking code in a safe environment.

All functions are stored in the folder code.
All tex files and code used for referencing is stored in the Tex folder


```{r}
# We can get a quick idea of how many instances (rows) and how many attributes (columns) the data contains with the dim function.

# dimensions of dataset
dim(dataset)
```
```{r}
# list types for each attribute
sapply(dataset, class)
```

```{r}
# take a peek at the first 5 rows of the data
head(dataset, n=49)
```

```{r}
# list the levels for the class
levels(dataset$Species)
```
```{r}
# summarize the class distribution
percentage <- prop.table(table(dataset$Species)) * 100
cbind(freq=table(dataset$Species), percentage=percentage)
```

```{r}
summary(dataset)
```
